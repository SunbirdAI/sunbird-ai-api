  "audio_transcription": "Could you let us know about being a parent to a child with both autism? How and when did you know in the first place that you have a child with both autism? And we didn't notice at first, like my child, my nine-year-old has autism in eight. And at first we didn't really notice because developed mentally. He was hitting all of his milestones, so he was like, \"When babies start to crawl, he was within the range of starting to crawl. When babies are starting to walk, he is starting to walk when they are toiletating independently.\" He is toileting independently, so there wasn't anything major he was talking about. We had a moment when we were like, \"Is he okay?\" But we had just gone to America for the first time. After having him here, we went to America. He heard all those American accents, and then we came. Back and then he got very quiet., like he had been starting to make those like baby-baby sounds. And then he got to Uganda and started hearing a choir again. And then we thought maybe it was like he was just listening, he was just trying to understand something. Shifted and how everyone is speaking and there is a second language. But then, after a couple of months, he just started speaking in full sentences and speaking a truly and English so is like okay, he was just learning his second language and so we didn't think anything of. It until twenty-twenty really so up until then. He was, you know, he's great kid, he's really sweet. He was a little bit we would call quirky in America, where he is just like, sometimes doing things a little different than he would when he would play with friends. It would Be sometimes he would just observe friends playing instead of actually actively playing with them. You know, and so he is like, \"I played with friends, and I'm thinking, I don't know that that counted, but you think you had a good time, so okay, it's okay, and so we are.\" I didn't really think too much of it until twenty twenty, which was a tough year for everyone because of the pandemic. And we were in Uganda, going through lockdowns just like everyone else, and not leaving our compounds. Staying at home, and he missed seeing his friends, you know. All of our social lives have all gone away and we are all with ourselves. And so, towards the end of twenty-twenty, my normally very chatty,very like, lots of story-telling. Big imagination stopped really speaking, he would share if he had a like, so if he needed. To if he was hungry or if he was tired, he would say, \"Mom, I'm hungry, Mom, I want something to eat. I'm tired, but instead of telling us these interesting stories, he's just bringing us into his world.\" You know, with his words, he just stopped speaking and that's it. Was our first real signs like some things wrong? People don't just stop talking to you now. That's not normally what's going on, and where is our son? It's like we missed him and we missed our normal conversations and our life that we had grown used to with him and so on. And he had also replaced those times of talking and sharing with us with what we now know to be.",
